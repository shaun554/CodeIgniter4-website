			At CodeIgniter, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. <br/>
			But no matter how much effort we put into system security, 
			there can still be vulnerabilities present.
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">
			<p>If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it 
				so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. 
				We would like to ask you to help us better protect our clients 
				and our systems.</p>

			<p>Please do the following: 
			<ul>
				<li>E-mail your findings to 
					<a href="mailto:security@codeigniter.com">security@codeigniter.com</a> 
					or report them on our 
					<a href="https://hackerone.com/codeigniter">HackerOne page</a></li>
				<li>Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you 
					have discovered, for example by downloading more data than 
					necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability or deleting or 
					modifying other people's data</li>
				<li>Do not reveal the problem to others until it has been resolved</li>
				<li>Do not use attacks on physical security, social engineering, 
					distributed denial of service, spam or applications of 
					third parties, and</li>
				<li> Do provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem, 
					so we will be able to resolve it as quickly as possible. 
					Complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>What we promise: 
			<ul>
				<li>If you have followed the instructions above, we will not 
					take any legal action against you in regard to the report</li>
				<li>We will handle your report with strict confidentiality,
					and not pass on your personal details to third parties 
					without your permission</li>
				<li>We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving 
					the problem, and</li>
				<li>Where appropriate, we are happy to credit those
					who find or fix security issues.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				We strive to resolve all problems as quickly as possible, and 
				if applicable we would like to play a role in the publication 
				of the problem after it is resolved.
